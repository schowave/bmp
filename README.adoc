- Replace the COPY bmp /dos/bmp with your game.
- You can also change the default password, or override it with a -e parameter when you run the image.
- Now, with Docker, build the image. I’m assuming you already have Docker installed and are familiar with it to some extent. CD to the directory in a console and run the command…

[source]
----
docker build -t mydosbox .
----

- Run the image.

[source]
----
docker run -p 6080:80 mydosbox
----

- Open a browser and point it to http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
- You should see a prompt for the password. Type it in, and you should be able to connect to your container with DosBox running. The game is started automatically.
- Once your image is built, you can push it to your image repository with docker push, but you’ll need to tag it appropriately.
